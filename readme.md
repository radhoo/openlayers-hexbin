# Openlayers-hexbin
This is a small javascript to make any vector layer into hexbins. It will use the colors from you vectorstyle, except for the transparancy that at the moment allways will be a fixed value. (This has to do with performance.)

A live demo of the output can be viewed at:

## Usage
### hexbin.on(layer)
This will turn on hexbinning on a layer.
### hexbin.un(layer)
this will turn off hexbinning on a layer.

## License
Simple three clause MIT license.

## Requirements
It's made for Open Layers, so you will need that, otherwise none.
